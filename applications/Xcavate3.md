## Project Overview

Total global Real Estate was valued at over $378.7 trillion at the end of 2022 (Source: Savills Research, and Savills Research using World Bank, Bank for International Settlements, World Federation of Exchanges, World Gold Council). This eye watering sum remains the largest store of wealth across all sectors. Yet only 1.1% of the global population own nearly half of the world’s total wealth (Source: Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook 2021). Due to the complex nature of real estate investment and the traditional need for trusted intermediaries, many real estate investment opportunities are not possible for the average person.

Nearly 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions come from the real estate sector (Source: Forbes article by David Carlin Apr 5, 2022). Approximately 70% are produced by building operations, while the remaining 30% comes from construction.

An estimated 150 million people are homeless globally, though the real number is probably higher (Source: The World Economic Forum website article by Patrick Henry Oct 2021).

The Xcavate blockchain protocol aims to tackle these issues by leveraging the power of blockchain technology, digital identity, oracles and custom substrate pallets to introduce transparency, security, accessibility and sustainability to the real estate market.

The real estate centric lending and asset tokenisation protocol has been built to deliver net positive CO2 emissions and social inclusion through a combination of specific dApps and transaction fees, governed by its community through a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).


### Overview

We have already built a lending and asset tokenisation protocol using the substrate framework. The overall design of our Appchain is based on a real estate investment centric community of interrelated dApps. While real estate offers many benefits, the wealth it creates is very concentrated on a small percentage of the global population. It also greatly impacts the environment through CO2 generating construction processes, as well as heating consumption and generation of waste. To offset the impact of real estate construction and to help the redistribution of wealth, we are building a dApp to make a fairer web3 future.

### Project Details

Milestone 1 = Creating the realXchange feeless NFT marketplace dApp consists of a react.js frontend, node.js backend interacting with a custom substrate pallet called the "Community Projects Pallet". By channeling a percentage of fees generated from the sale of real estate NFTs on the Xcavate (and other related dApps). A decentralised web3 crowd funding marketplace supports the delivery of projects in the following categories; environmental, ecological, social & housing that impact global communities. By leveraging verifiable credentails (for both individuals and charities), kilt digital identifiers (DIDs) for all project managers, potential NFT buyers can confidently buy NFTs for a specific project. The NFT holder then votes on each stage the delivery of that project until the project is complete.

Milestone 2 = Enabling XCAV token holders to be able to bond their tokens to a particular realXchange project, so that project gets that amount of funds (delivered from fees generated from Xcavate and other related dApps).

### Technology Stack

* React.js
* Node.js
* Substrate Framework
* Polkadot

### Third-Party

* Kilt
* Deloitte

### Ecosystem Fit

We feel this is a great way to bring new users and Real-World Assets like, Land & Property into the general ecosystem while also funding worthwhile causes. We also recognise the need for specific potential partnerships with both new and established players in the Polkadot space:

**Bitgreen**
Measure impact on CO2 emission reductions. Introduce the funding solution to their partners.
**Kilt Protocol**
Create new verifiable credentials for real world assets like land and property.
**Deloitte**
Creating verifiable credentials, which will be held in a wallet and used throughout the process for KYC/KYB/AML
**Subwallet / Nova Wallet / Pluto Wallet**
Integrate DID's and Real Estae NFTs in to the their wallet to improve the UI/UX

## Development Status :open_book:

We have been heavily involved in learning all things associated with the Polkadot & Kusama Ecosystem. This has been coupled with the idea of bringing illiquid assets like land and property from its current state into the web3 ecosystem. We have met top-level industry leads, government officials, real estate developers and retail investors to deliver a protocol that will provide a real benefit to broad range of users.

Robin Ejsmond-Frey, Nico Morgan, Clif, Joshua Cheong from Parity have been a tremendous help by supporting us with information about the W3F grant application process and recommendations to attend Hackathons, Polkadot Decoded & Sub0 Events. As well as as number of forums to help our substrate development knowledge.

We have been taking time to play with Substrate to form initial local nodes. We have developed the initial POC for this project and are developing using the Rococco test environment. We have additional engaged with the Tanssi network to test their appchain launching network.


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  4.5 (3x0.5 + 3x1)
- **Total Costs:** $16000 USDT

### Milestone 1 — Phase 3 Xcavate & realXchange dApp
- **Estimated Duration:** 5 weeks
- **FTE:**  4.5 (3x0.5 + 3x1)
- **Costs:** $10000 USDT

We will build on the excellent work we have achieved developing the initial milestone.

In the second milestone, we will bring all of the functionality together so the process of taking out a real estate development loan, loan staking and loan repayment through the sale of property NFTs can be all initiated and managed through a react.js based frontend to the Xcavate substrate protocol.

## Future Plans

We have recently attended the Relayers Incubator Program and have applied to the Substrate builder program. We are launching our project on the Polimec platform in Jan 2024 to raise funds to secure a Parachain slota and launch mainet around end of Q1 2024.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

We are engaged in supporting the PBA in trying to attract potential engineers and founders to both Hong Kong as well as Singapore cohorts in 2024.
